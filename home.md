 <p align="center"> <b>About Me</b>

<p align="center">My name is Marissa and I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in California until the age of 15 and moved to North Carolina for three years. After my highschool graduation, I decided to start fresh in Oklahoma and be close to my father. My life here is <i>pretty</i> good. I have a wonderful home with my two beautiful children and my two furr babies Nina and Bandit, who between the four of them, keep my very busy and I <b>love</b> it. I have completed some school at Rose State College and are six credits away from obtaining my Associates in Business Management. I must say, I do enjoy being in school and being able to accomplish new things. I am a homebody so a good night for me is cuddled up at home with <i>happy</i> babies while watching a movie. Like everyone, life has definetly given me my obstacles, but everyday I push through them and continue to persevere.
 
  
<p align="center"> <b>Goals</b>
<p align="center">A goal of mine is to complete my <b>CRTL+SHIFT code school</b> and to truley challenge myself to this wonderful oppurtunity and take in all that is offered to me.  My goal is to ace my internship and be able to be confident in the knowledge I have gained and be able to broadcast it effectively. Another goal is to stay organized and create a routine and <b>FOLLOW</b> it. All of this is easier said than done so I will have to discipline myself to achieve these results.
